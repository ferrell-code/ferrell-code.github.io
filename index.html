          Hello earthlings, I am Charlie and this is my website! Check out the links above!<br><br>A few things about myself are
          that I like to hike, garden and cook.

          Another passion of mine is programming.<br><br>
          Isn't it amazing that one tiny js file can create these animations!<br><br>
          However, the libraries utilized aren't tiny (it uses Three.js which
          hooks into WebGL and eventually to machine code).<br><br>
          This website illustrates the tremendous power of abstraction.<br><br>
          I ask you to ponder who created this website? I would reply not I, but rather the collective of mankind.

          Every time we build something like this website it is truly like standing on the
          shoulders of giants, thousands of people building off others work, the absolute pinnacle of
          humankind!<br><br>

          I encourage you to join us :)<br><br>
